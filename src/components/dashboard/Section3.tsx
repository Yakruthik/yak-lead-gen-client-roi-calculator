  // Script 1: ROI Breakeven (Best for CFOs & Finance-Focused Buyers)
  const script1 = `Your average deal is ${highlight(fmt(outputs.calculatedAacv))}. My annual cost is ${highlight(fmt(outputs.annualCost))}. So mathematically, you break even after closing just ${highlight(outputs.breakeven + ' deals')} with the leads I generate. Every deal after deal number ${outputs.breakeven} is pure profit for you. Given that you're targeting ${highlight(inputs.newClientTarget + ' new clients')} annually, this investment pays for itself by Month 3 at your current conversion rate.`;

  // Script 2: Growth Ceiling (Best for Ambitious CEOs/Founders)
  const revPot = outputs.monthlyGap * 12 * outputs.valuePerMeeting;
  const roiRatio = outputs.annualCost > 0 ? (revPot / outputs.annualCost).toFixed(1) : '0';
  const script2 = `Here's what I'm seeing: You want to hit ${highlight(inputs.newClientTarget + ' new clients')} this year, but your current meeting volume falls short by ${highlight(outputs.monthlyGap.toFixed(1) + ' qualified SQL meetings per month')}. That gap is a hard ceiling on your growth. You can't close what you're not talking to. Right now, you're leaving ${highlight(fmt(revPot))} in annual revenue on the table just because the pipeline isn't full enough. For ${highlight(fmt(outputs.annualCost))} annually, I close that gap and unlock that revenue potential. That's a ${roiRatio}:1 ROI after my cost—you're profitable in Month 3.`;

  // Script 3: Churn Replacement (Best for Established Companies with Retention Pressure)
  const churnedClients = (inputs.activeCustomers * inputs.churnRate / 100) || 0;
  const script3 = `Based on what you shared: You've got ${highlight(inputs.activeCustomers + ' active clients')} at ${highlight(fmt(outputs.calculatedAacv))} each. With ${highlight(inputs.churnRate + '% annual churn')}, you're losing about ${highlight(fmt(outputs.churnRevenue))} in recurring revenue annually—and that's just to stay flat. To hit your growth target of ${highlight(inputs.newClientTarget + ' new clients')}, you need to fill the churn gap AND add new revenue. That means you need roughly ${highlight(Math.round(outputs.totalMeetingsNeeded) + ' SQL meetings this year')}. You're currently ${highlight(outputs.monthlyGap.toFixed(1) + ' meetings per month')} short. What we do is fill that gap. Every meeting we book is worth ${highlight(fmt(outputs.valuePerMeeting))} in potential revenue. Add that up over a year, minus my cost, and you're building a sustainable growth engine instead of just replacing churn.`;

  // Script 4: Pipeline Pressure (Best for Founders/Sales Reps in Trenches)
  const script4 = `Here's the reality: You need ${highlight(inputs.newClientTarget + ' new clients')} at ${highlight(fmt(outputs.calculatedAacv))} each. Your pipeline is ${highlight(outputs.monthlyGap.toFixed(1) + ' SQL meetings per month')} short of what you need to hit that target. That's the problem. Your close rate is locked in. Your deal size is locked in. What's NOT locked in is your pipeline. For ${highlight(fmt(outputs.annualCost))} annually, I solve that one variable. You hit your target. That's the deal.`;

  // Script 5: The LTV Math Angle (Best for Data-Driven Buyers)
  const ltvBudget = outputs.ltv * 0.35;
  const script5 = `Here's the math that matters for scaling: your LTV is ${highlight(fmt(outputs.ltv))}. That's your AACV of ${highlight(fmt(outputs.calculatedAacv))} multiplied by your average client lifespan of <span class="inline-block bg-secondary/20 px-2 py-0.5 rounded border border-secondary text-secondary font-semibold">${inputs.customerLifetime} years</span>. That's your revenue ceiling per client.

Against that, you can afford to spend up to ${highlight('30-40%')} of LTV on CAC and still be healthy long-term. That gives you a budget of roughly ${highlight(fmt(ltvBudget))} per client to acquire them.

My investment of ${highlight(fmt(outputs.costPerSQL))} per qualified meeting is well within that ceiling. And since you need ${highlight(inputs.sqlsPerWin.toString())} meetings to close an average deal, my total CAC per client through my service is efficient. This is how you scale without burning out your S&M team.`;

  // Script 6: CAC Efficiency (Best for CFOs/Finance Buyers)
  const totalBudgetAnnual = outputs.costPerSQL * outputs.totalMeetingsNeeded;
  const script6 = `Let me frame this as a CAC optimization play. Right now, your CAC is ${highlight(outputs.cacPercent.toFixed(1) + '%')} of AACV. ${highlight('Industry standard for high-ticket B2B SaaS is 25-35% of AACV.')} You're either right in the band or stretching it.

The math here is simple: instead of spending money on broad campaigns that generate low-quality volume, you're investing ${highlight(fmt(totalBudgetAnnual))} annually in qualified leads that match your ICP. We reduce your CAC waste and improve your close rate because you're not chasing tire-kickers.

Your LTV is ${highlight(fmt(outputs.ltv))}, so your LTV:CAC ratio ceiling is huge. We're essentially saying: let's shift budget from broad-based CAC into precision CAC. Better spend, better returns, predictable pipeline.`;
